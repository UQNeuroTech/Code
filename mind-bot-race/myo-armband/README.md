# Mind-Bot Race Demo code for the MYO Armband 

## Installation

You must use python 3.7.4. I tried using python 3.11 and it didn't work.

The Thalmic Myo SDK is only available for Windows and macOS, thus you can not
use `myo-python` on Linux (unfortunately). Use Pip to install the library:

    pip install 'myo-python>=1.0.0'
